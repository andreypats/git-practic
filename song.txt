I know there’s something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes yea
you’ve built a love but that love falls apart
your little piece of heaven turns to dark

Listen to your heart
when he’s calling for you
Listen to your heart
there’s nothing else you can do
I don’t know where you’re going
and I don’t know why
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye
